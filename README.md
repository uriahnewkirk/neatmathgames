# Neat Math Games
(javascript practice)



Hello,

This is a small webiste created using only basic HTML, CSS, & Javascript to practice and begin learning Javascript. I hope to use this as an example of my early work and to show that I have taken some of my personal time to strengthen my knowledge on these languages. Hope you enjoy and shoutout to KennyYip (https://github.com/ImKennyYip).
